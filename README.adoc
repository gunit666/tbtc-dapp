== Development

=== Setup

The dApp requires a version of the tbtc.js library corresponding to the
environment being tested on. Versions with version `-pre*` are for the Keep
internal testnet and _will not work_ with Ropsten. For Ropsten, look for
versions of tbtc.js labeled `-rc*` instead. Clones of the`main` branch of
this repository will by default use a `-pre*` version of the tbtc.js library;
this version can be adjusted in the `package.json` file.

*NOTE:* The `tbtc-dapp` package contains an indirect dependency to
`@summa-tx/relay-sol@2.0.2` package, which downloads one of its sub-dependencies
via unathenticated `git://` protocol. That protocol is no longer supported by
GitHub. This means that in certain situations installation of the package or
update of its dependencies using NPM may result in `The unauthenticated git
protocol on port 9418 is no longer supported` error. +
As a workaround, we advise changing Git configuration to use `https://` protocol
instead of `git://` by executing:
```
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```

=== Run

`npm start` runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000[http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in
the console.

== Docker

To build a Docker image execute:
```sh
docker build . -t tbtc-dapp
```

To run the Docker image execute:
```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 tbtc-dapp
```

This will expose the app under http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080].

== Internal Testnet

To access the internal Keep testnet you need to be connected to it via VPN.
Contracts with which the app is interacting are deployed under an address that
depends on the current deployment; the latest `tbtc.js` version with prerelease
id `pre` should point to the deployed version.

=== MetaMask

To use the internal testnet, a custom network must be added to MetaMask:
